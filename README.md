# Sea_Level_Predictor

The Sea Level Predictor project analyzes global sea level changes from 1880 to forecast levels through 2050. It uses Python with Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for visualization.

Key steps include:

Data Import: Load sea level data from a CSV file.

Scatter Plot: Create a scatter plot with years on the x-axis and sea levels on the y-axis.

Line of Best Fit: Use linear regression to find a line of best fit for the entire dataset and extend it to predict sea levels in 2050.

Recent Trends: Calculate a second line of best fit using data from 2000 onward to project future sea level rise.

Visualization: Label the axes and add a title to the plot.

This project helps visualize potential sea level changes, contributing to discussions on climate impact and adaptation strategies.
